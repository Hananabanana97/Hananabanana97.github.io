      Laboratory support scientist at Alderley Analytical, July 2019- September 2019
    </p>
    <ul class="second_list">
      <li>Independent - I managed my own workload and enjoyed finding new tasks and responsibilities. This included covering my colleague’s workload (processing samples, blank matrices and analytical standards upon arrival) for the week he was off. I also taught other scientists how to complete sample processing.</li>
      <li>Great working attitude - applauded in my placement review. I am always keen to surpass expectations and find improvements. For example, creating a spreadsheet to track expiration dates of analytical standards so they could be easily identified, found and disposed of upon expiration.</li>
